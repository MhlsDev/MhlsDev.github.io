          <h2>Codecademy CLL moderator and Best Wishes for Christmas holiday season</h2>
          <h6>Thursday, December 6, 2018</h6>
          <br><br>
           <p>Well, its the time of the year where Christmas day is almost here and the new year is about to come knocking at our door once again. This Christmas has been a bit special for me, as i have been asked to, and yes, got to become a moderator in <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" alt="Codecademy web page" target="_blank">Codecademy's</a> Lifelong Learners online community. For those of you that are not familiar with Codecademy, its an online school for those that want to learn coding.</p>

          <span onclick="myFunction()">
          <a class="toggle butnmore" href="#p0002">More</a>
          </span>

          <div class="toggle-content" id="p0002">
            <p>It is an awesome opportunity for me, to become an active part of Codecademy's community at this point in my career, mostly because i get to participate in projects that will advance my coding skills rapidly. The school offers plenty of courses and intensives for lots of coding languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, Ruby, C++, and of course HTML, CSS etc. but also paths that will guide you to specific skill sets. Lot’s of the material is free, but paid pro plans and intensives are offered if you really want to get serious about learning.</p>

            <br><p>Personally in January I begin my JavaScript intensive, so i can extend my JS skills even more. JS is not the easiest programming language to learn, mostly because of it’s many quirks, but with the help of CLL’s online community, one has nothing to fear. Coding is an important skill for the future, whether you are a tech geek like me or not. The future is online, and being able to understand even a small piece of this amazing world, is essential imho.</p>

            <br><p>So, i wanna wish you all a happy holidays and a happy new year. May the new year fulfill our dreams, hopes, needs, help us evolve as human beings, and become better persons in our everyday life.</p>

          <h2>Not another Hello World post!</h2>
          <h6>Thursday, December 6, 2018</h6>
          <br><br>
          <p>Hello World!</p>
          <br><p>Ha! I bet you didn't see that coming (oh sure you did). No actually this is another 'Hello World!' post, but not one of those that greet you when you finish the setup process for a wordpress website or when you take your very first coding course. In fact this is a sincere 'hello' to the world and not just another placeholder for content. My name is Michael and i want to welcome you to my personal website, where i'm going to present my design and web development projects. </p>

          <span onclick="myFunction()">
          <a class="toggle butnmore" href="#p0001">More</a>
          </span>

          <div class="toggle-content" id="p0001">
            <p>Now someone might ask: why would you need a blog page in a website like this? To be honest, i am not sure. I owned a few websites during my almost 25 years of presence in the world wide web, and i always felt the need to have my own little space to share my thoughts with others. I guess at this moment, that's pretty much the need i am trying to fulfil. </p>

            <br><p>Now i am kind of anxious to upload my new blog section to the live website, so this post is going to be kind of short. Hopefully in the coming months, i will be able to share much more with you, during my design/developer/coding journeys. Expect this website to evolve, change, shrink or grow, but it will always maintain it’s minimalistic approach, since that is basically my personal design philosophy. Less is more (now i bet you never heard that one before either). At the end of this page you can find all the possible ways to follow or contact me, or by clicking the obvious link at the top menu.</p>

            <br><p>Until the next one, peace! //end of cliches</p>
