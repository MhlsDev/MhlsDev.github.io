          <h2>Upvote/Downvote implementation doesn't serve its purpose</h2>
          <h6>Wensday, December 12, 2018</h6>
          <br><br>
          <p>The other day i got stack with a coding “challenge”. Using JavaScript, i was trying to create a function that would modify the behaviour of some text, under certain circumstances. While i managed to get my function working, it didn’t work completely as intended. I scratched my head for a day or so on the issue and since my online research wasn’t successful, i decided to ask for some help from the developers community. I had two very different experiences.</p>

          <span onclick="myFunction()">
          <a class="toggle butnmore" href="#p001">More</a>
          </span>

          <div class="toggle-content" id="p001">
            <p>When i started my coding journeys, i created an account at Stack Overflow, since i considered it a popular choice among developers and their slogan there is <i>“where developers learn, share & build careers”</i>. But since i haven’t used it at all up to that point, i thought this was a good opportunity to go ahead and post asking for help. Now i want to say upfront that i have a really long experience with online communities, either by running my own or using them, and i don’t get “scared” easily. The experience over there though was disappointing from the very beginning.</p>

            <br><p>So i fire up the create a new post functionality, and right away i get prompted to search before posting in case something similar already exists. Fair enough i say, although don’t agree 100% with the prompt. Then i move on to the question creation page. While typing the title, i get similar question prompts, and a persistent popup that keeps annoying me by reminding me that the specific title of my question will probably get it downvoted or something like that anyway. I spend ten minutes trying to figure out the “right” title for my question that would please the “king of stack overflow”, with (believe me) no luck. Eventually i decided to go along anyway. Again i tried my main text to be a “good” question (despite the already “bad” title), used their functionality to provide my code, and eventually post my question. Did you get answers you ask? Oh i did get answers alright, but what kind of answers.</p>

            <br><p>First i noticed that my title was immediately “corrected” since i must have had something in there that didn’t please the “king of questions”. Then the downvotes started coming. After that, the answers started rolling in and boy were they critical. Most of them were correcting minor syntax flaws to my code, that were irrelevant to the solution of the problem i was facing. I honestly don’t mind people correcting my mistakes, that’s how you learn, but the way they were saying it was really annoying. It was more like, “hey moron, that part of your code is wrong”. I also got a couple probable solutions, even one that was solving the problem at hand but not the “right” way. Then two people started arguing, because the first one suggested a solution that was not unobtrusive enough, and eventually he started accusing me for not asking a very good question etc. you get the feeling. In the meantime i had even more downvotes. Long story short, did you get a solution to your problem you might ask? No i didn’t. The really funny part was that after that, i wasn’t able to ask questions anymore for some reason (they have some kind of reputation system that if your questions are not considered “good” enough, you can’t post anymore), or ask for clarification, making their whole system useless. I ended up deleting my account after just asking one question.</p>

            <br><p>Personally i disagree with the whole upvote/downvote approach in communities, (they use the same one in reddit too and many forums), since you are providing some form of “power” to the people that cannot handle it as they should. This system is supposed to determine what’s good and what is not, by the community. I have seen it many times and it doesn’t work. Mostly because it’s impossible for every post, thread or question in our case, the whole community to vote. What if only a 2% of the whole community is voting? I am not going to get further with this because it is a really long discussion with many variables, and if you ask me, it’s complexity proves it’s weakness. I also think that when the purpose of a community is learning, like it is with coding, and helping, there are not good or bad questions. For some people english might not be their native language (like me), or they can’t express their thoughts in typing, or they don’t know how to describe the problem they need help with due to lack of knowledge or whatever. So let the people ask i say, and if you really don’t like their question, simply don’t leave a response.</p>

            <br><p>So how did i solve my problem? Well i posted the same question to my learning group (its a group of people using slack, from an online school i use to learn programming, and i won't publish which one, so my view is not considered biased), and in 5 minutes i got a few kind answers and among them the perfect solution. Now that’s a coding community that actually helps. I don’t think i need to say anything more.</p>

            <br><p>Now that i read what i wrote, it makes me smile when i see how many words i used to describe the experience that worked, and the one that didn’t. Yeah, right, you might think: he is just promoting I just wish people would behave on the internet more, like they would if they sit physically across to each other.</p>

          <h2>Not another Hello World post!</h2>
          <h6>Thursday, December 6, 2018</h6>
          <br><br>
          <p>Hello World!</p>
          <br><p>Ha! I bet you didn't see that coming (oh sure you did). No actually this is another 'Hello World!' post, but not one of those that greet you when you finish the setup process for a wordpress website or when you take your very first coding course. In fact this is a sincere 'hello' to the world and not just another placeholder for content. My name is Michael and i want to welcome you to my personal website, where i'm going to present my design and web development projects. </p>

          <span onclick="myFunction()">
          <a class="toggle butnmore" href="#p000">More</a>
          </span>

          <div class="toggle-content" id="p000">
            <p>Now someone might ask: why would you need a blog page in a website like this? To be honest, i am not sure. I owned a few websites during my almost 25 years of presence in the world wide web, and i always felt the need to have my own little space to share my thoughts with others. I guess at this moment, that's pretty much the need i am trying to fulfil. </p>

            <br><p>Now i am kind of anxious to upload my new blog section to the live website, so this post is going to be kind of short. Hopefully in the coming months, i will be able to share much more with you, during my design/developer/coding journeys. Expect this website to evolve, change, shrink or grow, but it will always maintain it’s minimalistic approach, since that is basically my personal design philosophy. Less is more (now i bet you never heard that one before either). At the end of this page you can find all the possible ways to follow or contact me, or by clicking the obvious link at the top menu.</p>

            <br><p>Until the next one, peace! //end of cliches</p>
